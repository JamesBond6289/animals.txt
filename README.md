# animals.txt

#### As trying to learn sed and awk I was looking for a big, large file with reasonable data to exercise on so I bumped into [this interesting page](https://a-z-animals.com/animals/) and extracted 593 animals names into the animals.txt file.

#### I plan to include sed and awk commands and case studies I use for exercising as I'm learning more advanced features here in the README.md or into separate script files. 

### I hope this will be useful for you as well even if you should not be interested in sed and/or awk!
